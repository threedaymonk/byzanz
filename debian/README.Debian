byzanz for Debian
-----------------

Note for non-Gnome users:

Running this program would usually create an applet in the Gnome Panel, but
since the KDE Panel is not compatible, you have to use it as a command line
tool. It still has the same functionality but you won't see an icon in your
systray or a program starting when running byzanz from the menu in a
non-Gnome-environment.

You can Use byzanz-record directly in this case.
